1740 -- A New Stone Game
1.Description:
Alice and Bob decide to play a new stone game.At the beginning of the game 
they pick n(1<=n<=10) piles of stones in a line. Alice and Bob move the 
stones in turn. 
At each step of the game,the player choose a pile,remove at least one 
stones,then freely move stones from this pile to any other pile that still 
has stones. 
For example:n=4 and the piles have (3,1,4,2) stones.If the player chose 
the first pile and remove one.Then it can reach the follow states. 
2 1 4 2 
1 2 4 2（move one stone to Pile 2） 
1 1 5 2（move one stone to Pile 3） 
1 1 4 3（move one stone to Pile 4） 
0 2 5 2（move one stone to Pile 2 and another one to Pile 3） 
0 2 4 3（move one stone to Pile 2 and another one to Pile 4） 
0 1 5 3（move one stone to Pile 3 and another one to Pile 4） 
0 3 4 2（move two stones to Pile 2） 
0 1 6 2（move two stones to Pile 3） 
0 1 4 4（move two stones to Pile 4） 
Alice always moves first. Suppose that both Alice and Bob do their best in the game. 
You are to write a program to determine who will finally win the game. 

2.Input: The input contains several test cases. The first line of each test case contains an integer number n, denoting the number of piles. The following n integers describe the number of stones in each pile at the beginning of the game, you may assume the number of stones in each pile will not exceed 100. The last test case is followed by one zero. 
3.Output: For each test case, if Alice win the game,output 1,otherwise output 0.
